# Hi, I'm Septian! 👋

**Frontend Developer** | **Kuningan, Indonesia**

> "I focus on building frontend interfaces that are maintainable, consistent, and easy to evolve over time."

Welcome to my portfolio! This project showcases my journey, skills, and the work I've done as a developer with over 6 years of experience building production-ready web applications.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

My work sits at the intersection of design and engineering. I specialize in:

-   **React & Next.js**: Building performant, scalable applications.
-   **Clean UI**: Translating design intent into reusable components.
-   **Collaboration**: Working with cross-functional teams to deliver polished interfaces.

Earlier in my career, I contributed to a UI system at [Renos](https://www.renos.id/), defining component standards and visual consistency. I value clear communication, thoughtful problem-solving, and ownership.
